# Orders-retail-analysis
This Python script performs an ETL process for retail order data. It downloads the dataset from Kaggle, extracts it, and loads it into a DataFrame. The script cleans and transforms the data by handling null values, renaming columns, deriving features, and dropping unnecessary columns, then loads it into SQL Server.
